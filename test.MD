Scale: small

Justification: 

It may influence to travelers not to go to the less welcoming countries according with the map. This might not be very different from a propaganda map. It is interesting that the red countries or 'less welcoming to foreigners' appear to have governments that are radically different from a US democracy. For example, I am from Bolivia and my husband can attest that most Bolivians are very welcoming. We are in the less welcoming category according to the Washington Post. Due to our socialist government and ties to Venezuela and Ecuador, I believe we are perceived as less welcoming.
